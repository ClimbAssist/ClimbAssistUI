## Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Climb Assist! This is a big endeavor and we need help from folks like you to make
it great. We're new to being open source, so please let us know if you have any suggestions on how we can make things
better.

## I Have a Bug/Feature Request

Great! Submit it [here](https://github.com/ClimbAssist/ClimbAssistUI/issues). If it's a bug, be sure to include the date and time when you experienced, as
well as reproduction steps. If it's a feature request, try to be crisp and break it into manageable tasks. We only have
one maintainer right now, so we can't guarantee that we will be able to look at it right away, but we'll do our best!

## I Want to Help

Great! If you're looking to help with front-end development, you're in the right place. If you would like to work on the back end see the
[back end repository](https://github.com/ClimbAssist/ClimbAssistService)

Check out the [README](README.md) for details on cloning, running, and testing. In general, features should be
implemented in a new branch, and if they correspond with a bug/feature request, it's useful to include the tracking
number in the branch name. Once you've made code changes and you're confident that they work, submit a pull request and
one of our moderators will take a look at it as soon as they can. We only have one maintainer right now, so it might
take some time before your request can be looked at, but we promise we will review it as soon as we can!

## I Want to Help but I Don't Know How to Code!

That's fine too! We have lots of ways for non-developers to help. Checkout the
[contribution page](https://climbassist.com/contribute) on the website for more information.
